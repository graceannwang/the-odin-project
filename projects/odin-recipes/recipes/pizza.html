        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish consisting of 
            a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, 
            cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, 
            olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally 
            in a wood-fired oven.</p>
        <p>In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, 
            and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut 
            into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>
