What kind of program is Git?
    Git is a Version Control System (VCS) which means that it helps to track changes made to documents over time for the
    purposes of recalling previous versions of those documents in the future. More specifically, Git is a Distributed VCS, which 
    means that when a client checks out a repository, they are not checking out the most recent snapshot of documents but the 
    entire edit history of those documents. This provides the advantage of faster lookup times and added security against 
    losing the data in the repository.

What are the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping?
    - Git makes the differences between versions more explicit
    - Text editors often only track changes to a document for the time the editor is open. Changes made in previous sessions
        will not be available.
    - When using a text editor, if the user needs to revert back to a previous version, they may have to press the undo button 
        many times. 
    - Git gives the user control over when to take a "snapshot" of their document, allowing the user to be more deliberate
        over what changes are actually tracked.

Does Git work at a local or remote level?
    Local.

Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?
    Remote.

Why is Git useful for an individual developer?
    The ability to revert to discrete versions of your code adds a layer of security.

Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?
    - It's easy and relatively "cheap" to create branches compared to other VCSs.
    - Git is supportive of nonlinear development.
    - Even if repository data is corrupted on the "central" Github servers, an older version of that repository can be restored
        using local copies of repositories from the dev team.
    - Team members won't have to rely on an internet connection to access the repository history.
